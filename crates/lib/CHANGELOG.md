## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-07

Initial proof-of-concept release. Very experimental but is minimally viable to start using.

Eidetica is a peer-to-peer decentralized database. It's rough around the edges, but you can store data, sync between peers, and build local-first apps with it. The core architecture is in place: content-addressable entries organized in trees, pluggable storage backends, authentication, and basic peer connectivity through iroh.

Features in this release:

- **Data stores**: DocStore (document-oriented), Table (record-oriented), and optional Y-CRDT integration
- **Merkle-CRDT architecture**: Content-addressable entries with deterministic conflict resolution
- **Authentication**: Ed25519 signature-based with granular Admin/Write/Read permissions per database
- **Peer sync**: Basic P2P connectivity and synchronization via iroh
- **Transactions**: Atomic operations across multiple stores in a database
- **Pluggable backends**: In-memory backend included, designed for custom storage implementations
- **User management**: Multi-user support with encrypted private keys

Warning: no migration paths or backward compatibility guarantees yet.
