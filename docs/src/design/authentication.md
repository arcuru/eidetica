## Overview

Eidetica's authentication scheme is designed to leverage the same CRDT and Merkle-DAG principles that power the core database while providing robust access control for distributed environments. Unlike traditional authentication systems, this design must handle authorization conflicts that can arise from network partitions and concurrent modifications to access control rules.

**As of the current implementation, authentication is mandatory for all entries.** All database operations require valid Ed25519 signatures, eliminating the concept of unsigned entries. This ensures data integrity and provides a consistent security model across all operations.

The authentication system is **not** implemented as a pure consumer of the database API but is tightly integrated with the core system. This integration enables efficient validation and conflict resolution during entry creation and tree merging operations.

## Design Goals and Principles

### Primary Goals

1. **Mandatory Authentication**: All entries must be cryptographically signed - no unsigned entries allowed
2. **Distributed Consistency**: Authentication rules must merge deterministically across network partitions
3. **Cryptographic Security**: All authentication based on Ed25519 public/private key cryptography
4. **Hierarchical Access Control**: Support admin, read/write, and read-only permission levels
5. **Delegation**: Support for delegating authentication to other trees without granting admin privileges (infrastructure built, activation pending)
6. **Auditability**: All authentication changes are tracked in the immutable DAG history

### Non-Goals

- **Perfect Security**: Admin key compromise requires manual intervention
- **Real-time Revocation**: Key revocation is eventually consistent, not immediate

## System Architecture

### Authentication Data Location

Authentication configuration is stored in the special `_settings` subtree under the `auth` key. This placement ensures that:

- Authentication rules are included in `_settings`, which contains all the data necessary to validate the tree and add new Entries
- Access control changes are tracked in the immutable history
- Settings can be validated against the current entry being created

The `_settings` subtree uses the `crate::crdt::Doc` type, which is a hierarchical CRDT that resolves conflicts using Last-Write-Wins (LWW) semantics. The ordering for LWW is determined deterministically by the DAG design (see CRDT documentation for details).

**Clarification**: Throughout this document, when we refer to `Doc`, this is the hierarchical CRDT document type that wraps internal Node structures supporting nested maps. The `_settings` subtree specifically uses `Doc` to enable complex authentication configurations.

### Permission Hierarchy

Eidetica implements a three-tier permission model:

| Permission Level | Modify `_settings` | Add/Remove Keys | Change Permissions | Read Data | Write Data | Public Tree Access |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| **Admin**        | ✓                  | ✓               | ✓                  | ✓         | ✓          | ✓                  |
| **Write**        | ✗                  | ✗               | ✗                  | ✓         | ✓          | ✓                  |
| **Read**         | ✗                  | ✗               | ✗                  | ✓         | ✗          | ✓                  |

## Authentication Framework

### Key Structure

The current implementation supports direct authentication keys stored in the `_settings.auth` configuration. Each key consists of:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AuthKey {
        String pubkey
        Permission permissions
        KeyStatus status
    }

    class Permission {
        <<enumeration>>
        Admin(priority: u32)
        Write(priority: u32)
        Read
    }

    class KeyStatus {
        <<enumeration>>
        Active
        Revoked
    }

    AuthKey --> Permission
    AuthKey --> KeyStatus
```

**Note**: Both direct keys and delegated trees are fully implemented and functional, including `DelegatedTreeRef`, `PermissionBounds`, and `TreeReference` types.

### Direct Key Example

```json
{
  "_settings": {
    "auth": {
      "KEY_LAPTOP": {
        "pubkey": "ed25519:PExACKOW0L7bKAM9mK_mH3L5EDwszC437uRzTqAbxpk",
        "permissions": "write:10",
        "status": "active"
      },
      "KEY_DESKTOP": {
        "pubkey": "ed25519:QJ7bKAM9mK_mH3L5EDwszC437uRzTqAbxpkPExACKOW0L",
        "permissions": "read",
        "status": "active"
      },
      "*": {
        "pubkey": "*",
        "permissions": "read",
        "status": "active"
      },
      "PUBLIC_WRITE": {
        "pubkey": "*",
        "permissions": "write:100",
        "status": "active"
      }
    },
    "name": "My Tree"
  }
}
```

**Note**: The wildcard key `*` enables global permissions for anyone. Wildcard keys:

- Can have any permission level: "read", "write:N", or "admin:N"
- Are commonly used for world-readable trees (with "read" permissions) but can grant broader access
- Can be revoked like any other key
- Can be included in delegated trees (if you delegate to a tree with a wildcard, that's valid)

### Entry Signing Format

Every entry in Eidetica must be signed. The authentication information is embedded in the entry structure:

```json
{
  "tree": {
    "root": "tree_root_id",
    "parents": ["parent_entry_id"],
    "data": "{\"key\": \"value\"}",
    "metadata": "{\"_settings\": [\"settings_tip_id\"]}"
  },
  "subtrees": [
    {
      "name": "users",
      "parents": ["parent_entry_id"],
      "data": "{\"user_data\": \"example\"}"
    }
  ],
  "auth": {
    "sig": "ed25519_signature_base64_encoded",
    "key": "KEY_LAPTOP"
  }
}
```

The `auth.key` field can be either:

- **Direct key**: A string referencing a key name in this tree's `_settings.auth`
- **Delegation path**: An ordered list of `{"key": "delegated_tree_1", "tips": ["A", "B"]}` elements, where the last element must contain only a `"key"` field

The `auth.sig` field contains the base64-encoded Ed25519 signature of the entry's content hash.

## Key Management

### Key Lifecycle

The current implementation supports two key statuses:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Active: Key Added
    Active --> Revoked: Revoke Key
    Revoked --> Active: Reactivate Key

    note right of Active : Can create new entries
    note right of Revoked : Historical entries preserved, cannot create new entries
```

### Key Status Semantics

1. **Active**: Key can create new entries and all historical entries remain valid
2. **Revoked**: Key cannot create new entries. Historical entries remain valid and their content is preserved during merges

**Key Behavioral Details**:

- Entries created before revocation remain valid to preserve history integrity
- An Admin can transition a key back to Active state from Revoked status
- Revoked status prevents new entries but preserves existing content in merges

### Priority System

Priority is integrated into the permission levels for Admin and Write permissions:

- **Admin(priority)**: Can modify settings and manage keys with equal or lower priority
- **Write(priority)**: Can write data but not modify settings
- **Read**: No priority, read-only access

Priority values are u32 integers where lower values indicate higher priority:

- Priority `0`: Highest priority, typically the initial admin key
- Higher numbers = lower priority
- Keys can only modify other keys with equal or lower priority (equal or higher number)

**Important**: Priority **only** affects administrative operations (key management). It does **not** influence CRDT merge conflict resolution, which uses Last Write Wins semantics based on the DAG structure.

## Delegation (Delegated Trees)

**Status**: Fully implemented and functional with comprehensive test coverage. Delegated trees enable powerful authentication delegation patterns.

### Concept and Benefits

Delegation allows any tree to be referenced as a source of authentication keys for another tree. This enables flexible authentication patterns where trees can delegate authentication to other trees without granting administrative privileges on the delegating tree. Key benefits include:

- **Flexible Delegation**: Any tree can delegate authentication to any other tree
- **User Autonomy**: Users can manage their own personal trees with keys they control
- **Cross-Project Authentication**: Share authentication across multiple projects or trees
- **Granular Permissions**: Set both minimum and maximum permission bounds for delegated keys

Delegated trees are normal trees, and their authentication settings are used with permission clamping applied.

**Important**: Any tree can be used as a delegated tree - there's no special "authentication tree" type. This means:

- A project's main tree can delegate to a user's personal tree
- Multiple projects can delegate to the same shared authentication tree
- Trees can form delegation networks where trees delegate to each other
- The delegated tree doesn't need to know it's being used for delegation

### Structure

A delegated tree reference in the main tree's `_settings.auth` contains:

```json
{
  "_settings": {
    "auth": {
      "example@eidetica.dev": {
        "permission-bounds": {
          "max": "write:15",
          "min": "read" // optional, defaults to no minimum
        },
        "tree": {
          "root": "hash_of_root_entry",
          "tips": ["hash1", "hash2"]
        }
      },
      "another@example.com": {
        "permission-bounds": {
          "max": "admin:20" // min not specified, so no minimum bound
        },
        "tree": {
          "root": "hash_of_another_root",
          "tips": ["hash3"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The referenced delegated tree maintains its own `_settings.auth` with direct keys:

```json
{
  "_settings": {
    "auth": {
      "KEY_LAPTOP": {
        "pubkey": "ed25519:AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI...",
        "permissions": "admin:0",
        "status": "active"
      },
      "KEY_MOBILE": {
        "pubkey": "ed25519:AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI...",
        "permissions": "write:10",
        "status": "active"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Permission Clamping

Permissions from delegated trees are clamped based on the `permission-bounds` field in the main tree's reference:

- **max** (required): The maximum permission level that keys from the delegated tree can have
  - Must be <= the permissions of the key adding the delegated tree reference
- **min** (optional): The minimum permission level for keys from the delegated tree
  - If not specified, there is no minimum bound
  - If specified, keys with lower permissions are raised to this level

The effective priority is derived from the **effective permission returned after clamping**. If the delegated key's permission already lies within the `min`/`max` bounds its original priority value is preserved; when a permission is clamped to a bound the bound's priority value becomes the effective priority:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Delegated Tree: admin:5"] --> B["Main Tree: max=write:10, min=read"] --> C["Effective: write:10"]
    D["Delegated Tree: write:8"] --> B --> E["Effective: write:8"]
    F["Delegated Tree: read"] --> B --> G["Effective: read"]

    H["Delegated Tree: admin:5"] --> I["Main Tree: max=read (no min)"] --> J["Effective: read"]
    K["Delegated Tree: read"] --> I --> L["Effective: read"]
    M["Delegated Tree: write:20"] --> N["Main Tree: max=admin:15, min=write:25"] --> O["Effective: write:25"]
```

**Clamping Rules**:

- Effective permission = clamp(delegated_tree_permission, min, max)
  - If delegated tree permission > max, it's lowered to max
  - If min is specified and delegated tree permission < min, it's raised to min
  - If min is not specified, no minimum bound is applied
- The max bound must be <= permissions of the key that added the delegated tree reference
- Effective priority = priority embedded in the **effective permission** produced by clamping. This is either the delegated key's priority (when already inside the bounds) or the priority that comes from the `min`/`max` bound that performed the clamp.
- Delegated tree admin permissions only apply within that delegated tree
- Permission clamping occurs at each level of delegation chains
- Note: There is no "none" permission level - absence of permissions means no access

### Multi-Level References

Delegated trees can reference other delegated trees, creating delegation chains:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "sig": "signature_bytes",
    "key": [
      {
        "key": "example@eidetica.dev",
        "tips": ["current_tip"]
      },
      {
        "key": "old-identity",
        "tips": ["old_tip"]
      },
      {
        "key": "LEGACY_KEY"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Delegation Chain Rules**:

- The `auth.key` field contains an ordered list representing the delegation path
- Each element has a `"key"` field and optionally `"tips"` for delegated trees
- The final element must contain only a `"key"` field (the actual signing key)
- Each step represents traversing from one tree to the next in the delegation chain
- Permission clamping applies at each level using the minimum function
- Priority at each step is the priority inside the permission value that survives the clamp at that level (outer reference, inner key, or bound, depending on which one is selected by the clamping rules)
- Tips must be valid at each level of the chain for the delegation to be valid

### Delegated Tree References

The main tree must validate the delegated tree structure as well as the main tree.

#### Latest Known Tips

"Latest known tips" refers to the latest tips of a delegated tree that have been seen used in valid key signatures within the current tree. This creates a "high water mark" for each delegated tree:

1. When an entry uses a delegated tree key, it includes the delegated tree's tips at signing time
2. The tree tracks these tips as the "latest known tips" for that delegated tree
3. Future entries using that delegated tree must reference tips that are equal to or newer than the latest known tips, or must be valid at the latest known tips
4. This ensures that key revocations in delegated trees are respected once observed

#### Tip Tracking and Validation

To validate entries with delegated tree keys:

1. Check that the referenced tips are descendants of (or equal to) the latest known tips for that delegated tree
2. If they're not, check that the entry validates at the latest known tips
3. Verify the key exists and has appropriate permissions at those tips
4. Update the latest known tips if these are newer
5. Apply permission clamping based on the delegation reference

This mechanism ensures that once a key revocation is observed in a delegated tree, no entry can use an older version of that tree where the key was still valid.

### Key Revocation

Delegated tree key deletion is always treated as `revoked` status in the main tree. This prevents new entries from building on the deleted key's content while preserving the historical content during merges. This approach maintains the integrity of existing entries while preventing future reliance on removed authentication credentials.

By treating delegated tree key deletion as `revoked` status, users can manage their own key lifecycle in the Main Tree while ensuring that:

- Historical entries remain valid and their content is preserved
- New entries cannot use the revoked key's entries as parents
- The merge operation proceeds normally with content preserved
- Users cannot create conflicts that would affect other users' valid entries

## Conflict Resolution and Merging

Conflicts in the `_settings` tree are resolved by the `crate::crdt::Doc` type using Last Write Wins (LWW) semantics. When the tree has diverged with both sides of the merge having written to the `_settings` tree, the write with the higher logical timestamp (determined by the DAG structure) will win, regardless of the priority of the signing key.

Priority rules apply only to **administrative permissions** - determining which keys can modify other keys - but do **not** influence the conflict resolution during merges.

This is applied to delegated trees as well. A write to the Main Tree must also recursively merge any changed settings in the delegated trees using the same LWW strategy to handle network splits in the delegated trees.

### Key Status Changes in Delegated Trees: Examples

The following examples demonstrate how key status changes in delegated trees affect entries in the main tree.

#### Example 1: Basic Delegated Tree Key Status Change

**Initial State**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Main Tree"
        A["Entry A<br/>Settings: delegated_tree1 = max:write:10, min:read<br/>Tip: UA"]
        B["Entry B<br/>Signed by delegated_tree1:laptop<br/>Tip: UA<br/>Status: Valid"]
        C["Entry C<br/>Signed by delegated_tree1:laptop<br/>Tip: UB<br/>Status: Valid"]
    end

    subgraph "Delegated Tree"
        UA["Entry UA<br/>Settings: laptop = active"]
        UB["Entry UB<br/>Signed by laptop"]
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    UA --> UB
```

**After Key Status Change in Delegated Tree**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Main Tree"
        A["Entry A<br/>Settings: user1 = write:15"]
        B["Entry B<br/>Signed by delegated_tree1:laptop<br/>Tip: UA<br/>Status: Valid"]
        C["Entry C<br/>Signed by delegated_tree1:laptop<br/>Tip: UB<br/>Status: Valid"]
        D["Entry D<br/>Signed by delegated_tree1:mobile<br/>Tip: UC<br/>Status: Valid"]
        E["Entry E<br/>Signed by delegated_tree1:laptop<br/>Parent: C<br/>Tip: UB<br/>Status: Valid"]
        F["Entry F<br/>Signed by delegated_tree1:mobile<br/>Tip: UC<br/>Sees E but ignores since the key is invalid"]
        G["Entry G<br/>Signed by delegated_tree1:desktop<br/>Tip: UB<br/>Still thinks delegated_tree1:laptop is valid"]
        H["Entry H<br/>Signed by delegated_tree1:mobile<br/>Tip: UC<br/>Merges, as there is a valid key at G"]
    end

    subgraph "Delegated Tree (delegated_tree1)"
        UA["Entry UA<br/>Settings: laptop = active, mobile = active, desktop = active"]
        UB["Entry UB<br/>Signed by laptop"]
        UC["Entry UC<br/>Settings: laptop = revoked<br/>Signed by mobile"]
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> F
    C --> E
    E --> G
    F --> H
    G --> H
    UA --> UB
    UB --> UC
```

#### Example 2: Last Write Wins Conflict Resolution

**Scenario**: Two admins make conflicting authentication changes during a network partition. Priority determines who can make the changes, but Last Write Wins determines the final merged state.

**After Network Reconnection and Merge**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Merged Main Tree"
        A["Entry A"]
        B["Entry B<br/>Alice (admin:10) bans user_bob<br/>Timestamp: T1"]
        C["Entry C<br/>Super admin (admin:0) promotes user_bob to admin:5<br/>Timestamp: T2"]
        M["Entry M<br/>Merge entry<br/>user_bob = admin<br/>Last write (T2) wins via LWW"]
        N["Entry N<br/>Alice attempts to ban user_bob<br/>Rejected: Alice can't modify admin-level user with higher priority"]
    end

    A --> B
    A --> C
    B --> M
    C --> M
    M --> N
```

**Key Points**:

- All administrative actions are preserved in history
- Last Write Wins resolves the merge conflict: the most recent change (T2) takes precedence
- Permission-based authorization still prevents unauthorized modifications: Alice (admin:10) cannot ban a higher-priority user (admin:5) due to insufficient priority level
- The merged state reflects the most recent write, not the permission priority
- Permission priority rules prevent Alice from making the change in Entry N, as she lacks authority to modify higher-priority admin users

## Authorization Scenarios

### Network Partition Recovery

When network partitions occur, the authentication system must handle concurrent changes gracefully:

**Scenario**: Two branches of the tree independently modify the auth settings, requiring CRDT-based conflict resolution using Last Write Wins.

Both branches share the same root, but a network partition has caused them to diverge before merging back together.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Merged Main Tree"
        ROOT["Entry ROOT"]
        A1["Entry A1<br/>admin adds new_developer<br/>Timestamp: T1"]
        A2["Entry A2<br/>dev_team revokes contractor_alice<br/>Timestamp: T3"]
        B1["Entry B1<br/>contractor_alice data change<br/>Valid at time of creation"]
        B2["Entry B2<br/>admin adds emergency_key<br/>Timestamp: T2"]
        M["Entry M<br/>Merge entry<br/>Final state based on LWW:<br/>- new_developer: added (T1)<br/>- emergency_key: added (T2)<br/>- contractor_alice: revoked (T3, latest)"]
    end

    ROOT --> A1
    ROOT --> B1
    A1 --> A2
    B1 --> B2
    A2 --> M
    B2 --> M
```

**Conflict Resolution Rules Applied**:

- **Settings Merge**: All authentication changes are merged using Doc CRDT semantics with Last Write Wins
- **Timestamp Ordering**: Changes are resolved based on logical timestamps, with the most recent change taking precedence
- **Historical Validity**: Entry B1 remains valid because it was created before the status change
- **Content Preservation**: With "revoked" status, content is preserved in merges but cannot be used as parents for new entries
- **Future Restrictions**: Future entries by contractor_alice would be rejected based on the applied status change

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

#### Protected Against

- **Unauthorized Entry Creation**: All entries must be signed by valid keys
- **Permission Escalation**: Users cannot grant themselves higher privileges than their main tree reference
- **Historical Tampering**: Immutable DAG prevents retroactive modifications
- **Replay Attacks**: Content-addressable IDs prevent entry duplication
- **Administrative Hierarchy Violations**: Lower priority keys cannot modify higher priority keys (but can modify equal priority keys)
- **Permission Boundary Violations**: Delegated tree permissions are constrained within their specified min/max bounds
- **Race Conditions**: Last Write Wins provides deterministic conflict resolution

#### Requires Manual Recovery

- **Admin Key Compromise**: When no higher-priority key exists
- **Conflicting Administrative Changes**: LWW may result in unintended administrative state during network partitions

### Cryptographic Assumptions

- **Ed25519 Security**: Default to ed25519 signatures with explicit key type storage
- **Hash Function Security**: SHA-256 for content addressing
- **Key Storage**: Private keys must be securely stored by clients
- **Network Security**: Assumption of eventually consistent but potentially unreliable network

### Attack Vectors

#### Mitigated

- **Key Replay**: Content-addressable entry IDs prevent signature replay
- **Downgrade Attacks**: Explicit key type storage prevents algorithm confusion
- **Partition Attacks**: CRDT merging handles network partition scenarios
- **Privilege Escalation**: Permission clamping prevents users from exceeding granted permissions

#### Partial Mitigation

- **DoS via Large Histories**: Priority system limits damage from compromised lower-priority keys
- **Social Engineering**: Administrative hierarchy limits scope of individual key compromise
- **Timestamp Manipulation**: LWW conflict resolution is deterministic but may be influenced by the chosen timestamp resolution algorithm
- **Administrative Confusion**: Network partitions may result in unexpected administrative states due to LWW resolution

#### Not Addressed

- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Client-side key storage security is out of scope
- **Physical Key Extraction**: Assumed to be handled by client security measures
- **Long-term Cryptographic Breaks**: Future crypto-agility may be needed

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Validation Process

The current validation process:

1. **Extract Authentication Info**: Parse the `auth` field from the entry
2. **Resolve Key Name**: Lookup the direct key in `_settings.auth`
3. **Check Key Status**: Verify the key is Active (not Revoked)
4. **Validate Signature**: Verify the Ed25519 signature against the entry content hash
5. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the key has sufficient permissions for the operation

**Current features include**: Direct key validation, delegated tree resolution, tip validation, and permission clamping.

### Sync Permissions

Eidetica servers require proof of read permissions before allowing tree synchronization. The server challenges the client to sign a random nonce, then validates the signature against the tree's authentication configuration.

### CRDT Metadata Considerations

The current system uses entry metadata to reference settings tips. With authentication:

- Metadata continues to reference current `_settings` tips for validation efficiency
- Authentication validation uses the settings state at the referenced tips
- This ensures entries are validated against the authentication rules that were current when created

### Implementation Architecture

#### Core Components

1. **AuthValidator** (`auth/validation.rs`): Validates entries and resolves authentication

   - Direct key resolution and validation
   - Signature verification
   - Permission checking
   - Caching for performance

2. **Crypto Module** (`auth/crypto.rs`): Cryptographic operations

   - Ed25519 key generation and parsing
   - Entry signing and verification
   - Key format: `ed25519:<base64-encoded-public-key>`

3. **AuthSettings** (`auth/settings.rs`): Settings management interface

   - Add/update/get authentication keys
   - Convert between settings storage and auth types
   - Validate authentication operations

4. **Permission Module** (`auth/permission.rs`): Permission logic
   - Permission checking for operations
   - Permission clamping for delegated trees

#### Storage Format

Authentication configuration is stored in `_settings.auth` as a Doc CRDT:

```rust,ignore
// Key storage structure
AuthKey {
    pubkey: String,           // Ed25519 public key
    permissions: Permission,  // Admin(u32), Write(u32), or Read
    status: KeyStatus,        // Active or Revoked
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Current Implementation Status

1. **Direct Keys**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested
2. **Delegated Trees**: ✅ Fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage
3. **Permission Clamping**: ✅ Functional for delegation chains
4. **Delegation Depth Limits**: ✅ Implemented with MAX_DELEGATION_DEPTH=10

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Key Status**: Add Ignore and Banned statuses for more nuanced key management
2. **Performance Optimizations**: Further caching and validation improvements
3. User experience improvements for key management
