# Performance Best Practices

This document outlines performance optimization patterns used throughout the Eidetica codebase.

## Core Performance Principles

### 1. **Hot Path Optimization**

Identify and optimize performance-critical code paths. Common hot paths in Eidetica include CRDT state computation, entry storage/retrieval, authentication verification, bulk operations, and string conversions.

### 2. **Memory Efficiency**

Minimize allocations through appropriate string parameter types, pre-allocation of collections, stack allocation preference, and efficient caching strategies.

### 3. **Algorithmic Efficiency**

Choose algorithms that scale well with data size by using appropriate data structures, implementing caching for expensive computations, and preferring direct iteration over complex iterator chains in hot paths.

## String Parameter Optimization

### 1. **Parameter Type Selection**

Use `Into<String>` for stored parameters and `AsRef<str>` for lookup operations to minimize allocations and conversions.

### 2. **Bulk Operation Optimization**

Convert parameters upfront for bulk operations rather than converting on each iteration to reduce overhead.

## Memory Allocation Patterns

### 1. **Pre-allocation Strategies**

Allocate collections with known or estimated capacity to reduce reallocation overhead. Pre-allocate strings when building keys or compound values.

### 2. **Memory-Efficient Data Structures**

Choose data structures based on access patterns: BTreeMap for ordered iteration and range queries, HashMap for fast lookups, and Vec for dense indexed access.

### 3. **Avoiding Unnecessary Clones**

Use references and borrowing effectively. Work with references when possible and clone only when ownership transfer is required.

## CRDT Performance Patterns

### 1. **State Computation Caching**

Cache expensive CRDT state computations using entry ID and store name as cache keys. Immutable entries eliminate cache invalidation concerns.

### 2. **Efficient Merge Operations**

Optimize merge algorithms by pre-allocating capacity, performing in-place merges when possible, and cloning only when adding new keys.

### 3. **Lazy Computation Patterns**

Defer expensive computations until needed using lazy initialization patterns to avoid unnecessary work.

## Backend Performance Patterns

### 1. **Batch Operations**

Optimize backend operations for bulk access by implementing batch retrieval and storage methods that leverage backend-specific bulk operations.

### 2. **Connection Pooling and Resource Management**

Use connection pooling for expensive resources and implement read caching with bounded LRU caches to reduce backend load.

## Algorithm Optimization

### 1. **Direct Loops vs Iterator Chains**

Prefer direct loops over complex iterator chains in hot paths for better performance and clearer control flow.

### 2. **Efficient Graph Traversal**

Use iterative traversal with explicit stacks to avoid recursion overhead and maintain visited sets to prevent redundant processing in DAG traversal.

## Profiling and Measurement

### 1. **Benchmark-Driven Development**

Use criterion for performance testing with varied data sizes to understand scaling characteristics.

### 2. **Performance Monitoring**

Track operation timings in critical paths to identify bottlenecks and measure optimization effectiveness.

## Memory Profiling

### 1. **Memory Usage Tracking**

Implement allocation tracking for operations to identify memory-intensive code paths and optimize accordingly.

### 2. **Memory-Efficient Collections**

Use adaptive collection types that switch between Vec for small collections and HashMap for larger ones to optimize memory usage patterns.

## Common Performance Anti-Patterns

Avoid unnecessary string allocations through repeated concatenation, repeated expensive computations that could be cached, and unbounded cache growth that leads to memory exhaustion.

## Summary

Effective performance optimization in Eidetica focuses on string parameter optimization, memory-efficient patterns, hot path optimization, CRDT performance with caching, backend optimization with batch operations, and algorithm efficiency. Following these patterns ensures the system maintains good performance characteristics as it scales.
